Lab 4 Instructions:
In preparing these SQL SELECT statements, I followed the instructions below. 
The goal of the lab was to get students familiar with a certain
style/syntax of writing SQL statements. In future labs, the
syntax is expanded, and I use a more extensive set of features.

Rules
1. ALL information needs must be addressed with a single simple SELECT statement 
(i.e., a SELECT statement without
grouping, aggregation and nested subqueries) and/or with
UNION statements.

2. For this lab, I was not allowed to use the explicit JOIN syntax
in the FROM clauses of my SELECT statements.
