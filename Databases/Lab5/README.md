Lab 5 Instructions:
The information needs could be addressed with either a simple SELECT statement (i.e., a SELECT statement without grouping or nested
subqueries) and/or with the UNION operation, or with a SELECT statement that uses some aggregation (but not grouping). 
Some queries in this lab required me to immitate the intersection operation with other available means. 
Each information need must have been met with a single SQL statement.
