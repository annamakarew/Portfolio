Lab 6 Instructions:
Each information need in this lab could be represented by either a single SELECT statement possibly including aggregate operations,
GROUP BY and HAVING clauses, or by a number of SELECT statements combined using the UNION operator. 
Use of the JOIN syntax in the FROM clause was permitted (but we covered it some time later in the course), 
but all queries could be written without the use of JOIN syntax. Use of nested queries was still not permitted.
